# REACT-IONIC TEMPLATE

This project is bootstrapped with
[Create-React-App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a default,ejected webpack/react/ionic app inside a docker container awaiting
further configuration. This template is meant as a pure frontend stack.


## Overview

- frontend:
```
contains the central part of the template. this structure hints at the
extensibility of the structure and docker-compose.
```

- frontend/resources:
``` 
add any files you want to load via Dockerfile here
```

- scribble(empty directory, needs to be created in `frontend`):
``` 
contents of the generated container. bound to a docker volume
```
